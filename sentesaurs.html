              When given the words “hairy,” “cat,” and “run,” what’s the most complicated sentence you can come up with? Hm… What about “the fluffy feline proceeds quickly”? That’s exactly how Sentesaur begins. With a handful of adjectives, nouns, and verbs, players “blow up” simple words into the most elaborate, over-the-top sentences they can imagine.

              At the UW/UX Flow Designathon, Cathy Yin, Lily Song, and I secured second place with Sentesaur, a physical card game designed to help elementary school students build language skills in a fun, collaborative, and entirely screen-free way.

                How might we design exciting and inclusive learning experiences that reduce barriers for children in education?

              The solution must involve connection-centred design. Participants must design a solution that helps people build real connections, share meaningful experiences, and express themselves creatively. The UW/UX Flow Designathon strives to encourage participants to explore how UX can spark empathy, bring people together, and inspire collaborative, imaginative moments in everyday life.

            With the growing presence of AI and digital technology disrupting language development in children, we wanted to reintroduce the value of accessible, hands-on learning, especially for something as foundational as language, to alleviate youth’s over-reliance on screens and digital tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            While tossing around ideas, the beloved synonym dictionary, Thesaurus, stood out as our go-to tool for transforming plain words into hilariously convoluted sentences back when we were still learning English. Since board and card games held a special place in our childhood, we wanted to channel that familiar joy into a product that reduces educational barriers for children, specifically . This blend of nostalgic gameplay and wordplay ultimately sparked the core mechanic of Sentesaurs.

            In Sentesaur, Player Volcano draws three cards, an adjective, noun, and verb, and intentionally “erupts” these parts of speech into the most complex sentence possible. Palaeontologist players must then “dig out” the original card words by simplifying the sentence. Through this playful back-and-forth, students are encouraged to stretch their vocabulary, understand sentence structure, and consider conciseness without resorting to technology as a solution. Palaeontologist players can compete or collaborate to unearth the original words and collect egg fossil tokens to win, reinforcing both language development, and meaningful connections through shared imagination, problem-solving, and an ambition to succeed.

              Over the span of 10 hours, I had an absolute blast designing our little dinosaur kingdom alongside my teammates! Huge thanks to them for the laughter, creativity and hard work they brought throughout the entire process! And shoutout to UW/UX for hosting such an incredible event!
